### Bug Fixes (Index Corruption & Startup Reliability)

- **CRITICAL — Bug #1**: Fixed `addSortedIndex` and `addBitmaskIndex` overwriting already-loaded indexes with empty instances. Both methods now use `putIfAbsent` so that a persisted index loaded from disk by `_loadIndexes()` is preserved. The direct assignment caused every startup after the first to return empty query results and permanently corrupt the on-disk index.
- **GRAVE — Bug #2**: Fixed race condition in `openDatabase` where `FfastDb.instance` became accessible before secondary indexes were registered. Indexes are now passed into `FfastDb.init()` and registered before `open()` is called, so `_loadIndexes()` can match serialized blobs to the correct type and the singleton is never exposed in a half-initialized state.
- **GRAVE — Bug #3**: Fixed `_loadIndexes()` silently ignoring an index-type change between startups (e.g. `HashIndex` → `SortedIndex`). If the on-disk type differs from the pre-registered type the blob is now discarded; the index is rebuilt with the correct type via `_rebuildSecondaryIndexes()`, preventing silent O(n log n) degradation of range queries.
- **MODERATE — Bug #4**: Fixed a single corrupt document aborting the entire startup. `_rebuildSecondaryIndexes()` now wraps each `findById` call in a try/catch; corrupt documents are skipped and will be cleaned up on the next `compact()`.
- **GRAVE — Bug #5a**: Fixed O(n) memory allocation on every `startsWith` query with `HashIndex`. `_StartsWithCondition` now calls the new `HashIndex.filterKeys()` method, which iterates buckets without sorting or copying the full index, reducing per-query allocation from O(n) to O(k) where k is the number of matching documents.
- **GRAVE — Bug #5b**: Changed the default `autoCompactThreshold` from `0` (never compact) to `double.minPositive` (compact as soon as any dead document exists). This prevents the WAL file from growing unboundedly and eliminates the associated RAM spike on startup caused by replaying months of historical writes.

### Bug Fixes (Web Memory Crash)
- **CRITICAL (Web/IndexedDB)**: Rewrote `IndexedDbStorageStrategy` with **chunked incremental flush**. Data is now stored as 64 KB chunks in IndexedDB; `flush()` only writes the chunks modified since the last flush. Previously every `insert()`/`update()`/`delete()` copied the **entire** database buffer (e.g. 50 MB) from Dart to JavaScript, causing peak memory of ~3× the DB size per flush and OOM crashes on large databases. Peak memory per flush is now O(64 KB) instead of O(DB size).
- **Web/IndexedDB**: Backward-compatible migration — databases stored in the old single-key format (`<name>_buffer`) are loaded transparently and migrated to the chunked format on the next `flush()`.
- **Web/IndexedDB**: `truncate()` now cleans up orphan chunk keys in IndexedDB on the next flush, preventing stale data after `compact()`.
- **MemoryStorageStrategy**: `truncate()` now reclaims the backing `Uint8List` when the used size shrinks by more than 512 KB (matching the existing fix in `WebStorageStrategy` and `IndexedDbStorageStrategy`). Previously a database that grew to 64 MB and was compacted to 5 MB still held the 64 MB buffer in RAM.
- **Core**: Eliminated redundant `storage.flush()` calls in `_insertImpl()` and `_updateImpl()` when `dataStorage` is null (single-file mode). On web this avoided creating an unnecessary second IndexedDB transaction per operation.
- **Web**: Reduced default `cacheCapacity` in `openDatabase()` from 256 to 64 pages (1 MB → 256 KB). On web the entire database is already in RAM, so a large LRU page cache is redundant overhead.

### Bug Fixes (Memory)
- **OOM fix - `insertAll`**: Documents are now serialized and written to storage one at a time instead of accumulating all serialized `Uint8List` objects in RAM before writing. For large batches (e.g. 100K × 1KB docs) this eliminates ~100MB of peak heap usage.
- **B-Tree node cache**: Reduced `_nodeCacheCapacity` from 4096 to 512 deserialized nodes, cutting the in-memory node object overhead from ~16MB to ~2MB. Hot nodes remain fast via the underlying LRU page cache.
- **BitmaskIndex**: Default `maxDocId` reduced from 1,048,576 (128KB per bitset) to 65,536 (8KB per bitset). The index still grows automatically via `_grow()` when document IDs exceed the initial capacity, so behaviour is unchanged for large datasets.
- **`_BatchState` enum**: Removed the now-unused state-machine enum that was part of the old two-pass `insertAll` implementation.

### Bug Fixes & Code Quality
- **Web/LocalStorage**: Fixed `Uint8List` not found compile error by adding missing `dart:typed_data` import (caused incomplete package analysis and 0/50 static analysis score on pub.dev).
- **Static analysis**: Resolved all `lib/` warnings and infos: removed unused `dart:js_interop` import, fixed `return null` in `void` method, replaced `LinkedHashMap()` with collection literal, added `library;` directive to `open_database.dart`, made `FieldCondition` public (was `_FieldCondition`), fixed doc-comment angle brackets, and improved `prefer_is_empty` usage.

## 0.0.17

### Bug Fixes (Web Memory)
- **Web/IndexedDB**: `flush()` now skips the IndexedDB put when no data has changed since the last flush (`_dirty` flag). Eliminates redundant writes that fired 2-3× per `insert()`/`update()`/`delete()` when `needsExplicitFlush` is true.
- **Web/IndexedDB**: `flush()` no longer creates an intermediate Dart `sublist()` copy of the buffer. A zero-copy typed-data view (`buffer.asUint8List`) is used instead, reducing the peak RAM during flush from 3× to 2× the database size.
- **Web/IndexedDB & WebStorageStrategy**: `truncate()` now releases the backing `Uint8List` when the used size shrinks by more than 512 KB (e.g. after `compact()`). Previously the oversized buffer was retained in RAM until the page reloaded.
- **Web/LocalStorage**: Added `_dirty` flag (same flush-deduplication as IndexedDB) and overrides for both `write()` and `writeSync()`.
- **Web/LocalStorage**: `flush()` now catches `QuotaExceededError` (the ~5 MB `localStorage` limit) and throws a descriptive `StateError` that suggests switching to `useIndexedDb: true`, instead of silently losing data.

### Bug Fixes
- **Web**: Fixed `Function converted via 'toJS' contains invalid types` compiler error in `IndexedDbStorageStrategy` by removing an invalid `async` keyword from a JS interop closure.

## 0.0.14

### Critical Bug Fixes
- **CRITICAL**: Fixed `openDatabase()` unconditionally calling `FfastDb.disposeInstance()` at the start
  of every call. This caused `"Bad state: Cannot perform operations on a closed database"` errors
  when multiple code paths (e.g., a BLoC and a repository) called `ffastdb.init()` concurrently
  during app startup. The function now reuses the live instance if one is already open.
- **CRITICAL (Web)**: Fixed `IndexedDbStorageStrategy` using the hardcoded key `'db_buffer'` for all
  database instances. Opening two databases (e.g., `'users'` and `'products'`) caused their data to
  collide in the same IndexedDB slot. Each database name now gets its own isolated key
  (`'${name}_buffer'`).

### New Features
- `QueryBuilder.find()` — executes a query and returns the full document list directly.
  No more manual `findById` loop. Use via `db.query().where('field').equals('value').find()`.
- `QueryBuilder.findFirst()` — returns the first matching document or `null`, resolving only
  one document ID for efficiency.
- `QueryBuilder.count()` — returns the count of matching documents with an O(1) hot path
  for simple equality queries on indexed fields (reads the index bucket size directly).
- `FastDB.isOpen` getter — exposes whether the database instance is currently usable.

### Improvements
- Improved error message for closed-database operations: now explains the three most common
  causes and how to recover, instead of the previous generic `"Cannot perform operations..."`.
- `EncryptedStorageStrategy` doc comment updated with a clear security warning: it uses a
  Vigenère-style XOR cipher (obfuscation, not cryptographic-grade encryption). Guidance for
  using AES-256-GCM via `encrypt` / `pointycastle` is included.
- Barrel export (`package:ffastdb/ffastdb.dart`) now includes `EncryptedStorageStrategy` and
  the platform-appropriate storage strategy (`IoStorageStrategy` on native,
  `IndexedDbStorageStrategy` on web) — no more imports of internal `src/` paths.

### Critical Bug fixes
- **CRITICAL**: Fixed database corruption on Android/iOS caused by using `FileMode.append`. 
  On mobile platforms, `FileMode.append` ignores `setPosition()` calls and forces all writes 
  to the end of the file, corrupting B-tree nodes that need to be updated at specific offsets.
  Now uses `FileMode.write` which correctly respects random-access writes.

### API Changes
- Restored public `FastDB()` constructor for non-singleton use cases (benchmarks, multiple instances).
  For most applications, continue using `FfastDb.init()` with the singleton pattern.
