### Critical Bug fixes
- **CRITICAL**: Fixed database corruption on Android/iOS caused by using `FileMode.append`. 
  On mobile platforms, `FileMode.append` ignores `setPosition()` calls and forces all writes 
  to the end of the file, corrupting B-tree nodes that need to be updated at specific offsets.
  Now uses `FileMode.write` which correctly respects random-access writes.

### API Changes
- Restored public `FastDB()` constructor for non-singleton use cases (benchmarks, multiple instances).
  For most applications, continue using `FfastDb.init()` with the singleton pattern.

### Bug fixes
- Fixed corrupted documents being read silently from disk without checksum validation.
- Fixed database getting stuck when a batch insert fails halfway through.
- Fixed `compact()` not actually freeing disk space in single-file mode.
- Fixed index values greater than 2 billion being corrupted after a restart.
- Fixed memory growing unboundedly after many deletes or updates.
- Fixed nested `transaction()` calls silently corrupting rollback state — now throws a clear error.
- Fixed calling `beginTransaction()` twice discarding pending writes silently — now throws a clear error.
- Fixed `watch()` streams accumulating in memory after all listeners are gone.
- Fixed registering two adapters with the same `typeId` silently overwriting the first one — now throws an error.

### New features
- `DateTime` is now supported natively — no more manual conversion needed.

### Improvements
- Queries are noticeably faster: the query planner no longer runs each condition twice to estimate cost.
- `startsWith()` is now much faster on sorted indexes (uses a range scan instead of scanning everything).
